Get off to a good start in bioinformatics with this five-part online workshop in Introduction to Python. This workshop lays the foundation for successful bioinformatics experiments, including RNA-Seq, single cell RNA-Seq, epigenetics and more. Visit the course website for more information.

This workshop will teach the fundamentals of programming to beginning analysis of bioinformatics data using Python. We will start from the basic building blocks of programming and progress to using simple python packages for applied bioinformatics analysis.

A preliminary agenda for the week includes:

* Monday: Intro to VSCode, programming concepts, variables & data types, operators
* Tuesday: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, flow control
* Wednesday: Functions, Scope, Algorithms
* Thursday: Intro to Python Bioinformatics packages/modules, biopython, pysam
* Friday: Writing simple bioinformatics tools
