# Closing Thoughts


## Prerequisites for bioinformatics

* Access to a multi-core (24 cpu or greater), ‘high’ memory 64Gb or greater Linux server.
* Familiarity with the ’command line’ and at least one programming language.
* Basic knowledge of how to install software
* Basic knowledge of R (or equivalent) and statistical programming
* Basic knowledge of Statistics and model building


## Next Steps

My recommendation is to follow all of the instructions again, from the beginning on your own and send emails to [training.bioinformatics@ucdavis.edu](mailto:training.bioinformatics@ucdavis.edu) And we will be responsive to answering questions

### Anticipated 2021 slate of Workshop include

#### Continuous Workshops

* Metagenomes/Metatranscriptomes (At UCD)

#### Multiday Broken 1/2 - full day series
* Bioinformatics Prerequisites (Dual onsite and virtual)
    * Bash for biologists
    * Python for biologists
    * R for biologists
