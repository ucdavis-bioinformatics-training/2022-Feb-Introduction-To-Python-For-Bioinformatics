## Installing python3 and VSCode

### For Windows

First, install python3. Most of you will probably use the [python3 64-bit installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.1/python-3.10.1-amd64.exe). If you need another version, go to the [python3 downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and choose the one you want.

Next, install VSCode. Go to the [VSCode home page](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and it should automatically detect your OS and give you a download link. You can also go to the [downloads page](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads) and choose from there.

### For Macs

First, install python3. Most of you will probably use the [python3 64-bit universal2 installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.1/python-3.10.1-macos11.pkg). If you need another version, go to the [python3 downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/) and choose the one you want.

Next, install VSCode. Go to the [VSCode home page](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and it should automatically detect your OS and give you a download link. You can also go to the [downloads page](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads) and choose from there.

### For Ubuntu/Linux

First, install python3. Open a terminal and type "sudo apt install python3".

Next, install VSCode. Go to the [VSCode home page](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and it should automatically detect your OS and give you a download link. You can also go to the [downloads page](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads) and choose from there. Choose the ".deb" package. Once it is downloaded, open a Terminal and go to your Downloads directory. Type "sudo dpkg -i code_1.63.2-1639562499_amd64.deb" to install it.
