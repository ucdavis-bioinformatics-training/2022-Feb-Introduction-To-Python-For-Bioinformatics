# Putting it all together

Now that you've learned the basics of programming, it's time to write some beginning code. Let's write a program that will print the count for each nucleotide in a DNA sequence. You will need to use the "list" function which, when applied to a string, will return the string as a list of characters. You will also need to use loops and a dictionary. Create the program in a new file called "counts.py". You can use this sequence to begin with:

**CGGTAGTCGAGCTGCGGATATAATATGCATATAGATCGCACGCTAGCTCATAAAAGCATGCATGCGGCTAGCTGCTGATCGTGTCG**

Hints: 
1. First put the sequence in a variable.
2. Use the "list" function to break apart the sequence.
3. Iterate over the list using a loop.
4. Add the counts of each letter to a dictionary where the keys are the letters and the counts are the values.
5. Print out the dictionary using a loop.
